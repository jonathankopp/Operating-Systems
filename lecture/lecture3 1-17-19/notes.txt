#### String.h ####

- Strings are in read only memory
- It is not in the stack or the heap it is actually part of the code


#### Array Facts ####

char a[0] = "ABCD"; /* char a[0] = {'A', 'B', 'C', 'D', '\0'}; */
char b[4] = "ABCD"; /* char b[4] = {'A', 'B', 'C', 'D'}; */

#### File Descriptor (fd) ####

- Each process has a file descriptor table associated with it
-- Keeps track of its open files (i.e., byte streams)

fd				c++			Java					C
0 stdin   cin     System.in     scanf(), read(), getchar(), ...
1 stdout  cout    System.out    printf(), write(), putchar(), ...
2 stderr  cerr    System.err    fprintf(stderr, "ERROR:....\n");
																perror("open() failed");

- stdout and stderr (by default) are both displayed on the terminal

- stdout is line-buffered when output to the terminal
- stdout is block-buffered when output is redirected to an output file
- stderr (fd 2) is unbuffered


Before Open

fd table:
 0 stdin
 1 stdout
 2 stderr

After Open

fd table:
 0 stdin
 1 stdout
 2 stderr
 3 testfile.txt (O_RDONLY)

After Close

 fd table:
  0 <NULL>
	1 stdout
	2 stderr

DUP2 ==> duplicates a file indicator to make them interchangeable
